 2. Syntax:
 
 The words - predefined tokens are specified between " and ":

	program = "[" decllist ";" "{" stmtlist "}" "]"

	stmtlist = {stmt ";"}

	decllist = {declaration} | {arraydecl}

	declaration =  "decla" type indentifier	";"

	type = "int" | "string" | "char"
	
	arraydecl = "decla" type "arr" identifier ";"
	
	cmpdstmt = "{" stmtlist "}"
	
	ifstmt = "if"  condition "do" cmpdstmt "else" cmpdstmt
	
	forstmt = "for" identifier "<-" factor "," factor "do" cmpdstmt
	
	iostmt = ("read" | "show") "(" identifier ")"
	
	assignstmt = identifier "=" expression
	
	expression = expression ("+"|"-") term | term
	
	term = term ("*"|"/") factor | factor
	
	factor = "(" expression ")" | IDENTIFIER
	
	condition = expression relation expression
