 2. Syntax:
 
 The words - predefined tokens are specified between " and ":

	program = "[" decllist "{" stmtlist "}" "]"

	stmtlist = {stmt ";"}

	decllist = {declaration | arraydecl}

	declaration =  "decla" type indentifier	";"

	type = "int" | "string" | "char"
	
	arraydecl = "decla" type "arr" identifier ";"
	
	cmpdstmt = "{" stmtlist "}"
	
	ifstmt = "if"  condition "do" cmpdstmt ["else" cmpdstmt]
	
	forstmt = "for" identifier "<-" factor "," factor "do" cmpdstmt
	
	iostmt = ("read" | "show") "(" identifier ")"
	
	assignstmt = identifier "=" expression
	
	expression = expression ("+"|"-") term | term
	
	term = term ("*"|"/") factor | factor
	
	factor = "(" expression ")" | IDENTIFIER | const
	
	const = int | string | char
	
	condition = expression relation expression
	
	relation = "<" | "<=" | "==" | "<>" | ">=" | ">"
